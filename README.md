# push_swap

push_swap is a sorting algorithm project developed as part of the 42 programming school curriculum. This project's challenge is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, with the goal of using the fewest possible moves. The program takes a list of integers as arguments and outputs a series of instructions to sort them. 

## Visualizer

To better understand and analyze the sorting process, you can use the [push_swap visualizer](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer). This tool provides a graphical representation of the sorting algorithm in action.

## Key Features

- Implementation using linked lists for stack manipulation
- Custom sorting algorithm designed for clarity and understandability
- Efficient handling of various input sizes
- Robust error management

## Learning Objectives

- Advanced algorithm design and optimization
- Efficient use of linked lists in C
- Stack manipulation and sorting techniques
- Parsing and validating command-line arguments
- Implementing and using doubly linked lists

## Algorithm Approach

The sorting algorithm implemented in this project prioritizes clarity and ease of understanding over maximum efficiency. While it may not be the most optimized solution, it provides a solid foundation for comprehending the logic behind stack sorting algorithms.

## Usage

To run the push_swap program:

    ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23

This will output a series of instructions to sort the given numbers.
